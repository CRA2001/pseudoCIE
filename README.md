# PseudoCIE

## Introduction

PseudoCIE is a compiler designed specifically for the pseudocode syntax based on the one used for CIE IGCSE Computer Science Examinations.

The purpose of this is to provide a hands on and result driven coding language based on the one used in their exams to ease understanding of programming language techniques.

## Design

The compiler is divided into four sections: <br>

1. Lexer.py
2. Parser.py
3. Semantic.py
4. Main.py
